<p>
This was the first time I joined a CodinGame competition. <br>
It was a challenging and fun introduction to writing an AI that competes with others in a turn-based game. <br>
I wrote a brute force tree search algorithm that autonomously adjusts its max. search depth based on which depth it hit a target. <br>
It was able to search about 45K game states within the turn's time limits. <br>
At the end of the turn it compared all shortest combinations of moves that would lead to having sufficient ingredients to brew a potion, and choose the most optimal one. <br>
With this approach I managed to finish at position #421 in the Gold League. </p>
